# spinner
A slotlike spinner where you specify the winning number or letter - made with p5js
The first thing I've made with p5js, it's a bit rough around the edges but it works fairly smoothly. The function takes three arguments:
Spinner(winning number,length of the array of numbers, which html id it should be placed within)

This will be used later on for my browser game (arena.rikka.se) but with pictures of loot instead of numbers.
